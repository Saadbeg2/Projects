# Responsive Portfolio Website

This project is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my academic journey, skills, extracurricular activities, work experience, and resume. The website features a modern, clean design with smooth scrolling navigation and responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.

To ensure optimal viewing on different devices, I included a dark overlay with a message requesting users to view the site in full size when the browser window is resized below a specified width.

Key sections of the website include:
- **About Me**
- **High School**
- **College**
- **Extracurricular Activities**
- **Work Experience**
- **Resume**

This project highlights my journey and capabilities in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
