#Project Name
Bracket Decoder

#Description
Developed a C++ application to decode and validate bracketed strings using a custom linked list and frequency analysis. This project was completed as part of a school assignment in Fall 2023 when I was initially introduced to data structures. The application processes input strings by decoding nested brackets, sorting the decoded strings, and determining guilt or innocence based on the frequency of repeated values. It effectively demonstrates the use of linked lists for managing dynamic data, sorting algorithms for organizing information, and frequency analysis for detecting patterns within the data. The project involved reading input from files, performing complex string manipulations, and outputting the results to a file, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
