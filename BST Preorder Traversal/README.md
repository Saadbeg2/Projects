### Project Name
**BST Preorder Traversal**

### Description
Developed a C++ application to build a binary search tree from a list of integers and perform a preorder traversal. The traversal outputs the nodes along with their positions in the tree to an output file. This project demonstrates the use of recursive data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and file I/O operations in C++.

The application reads a list of integers from an input file, inserts them into the binary search tree while keeping track of their positions, and then performs a preorder traversal to write the node values and their respective positions to an output file. The traversal output includes detailed location information, showing the hierarchical structure of the tree.

The key components of the project include:
- **Node Structure**: Defines a tree node with data and pointers to left and right children.
- **Insert Function**: Recursively inserts values into the tree, maintaining the binary search tree property.
- **Preorder Traversal Function**: Recursively traverses the tree in preorder (root, left, right) and writes the node data along with their positions to the output file.
- **Main Function**: Manages file input/output, constructs the tree, and initiates the preorder traversal.

This project showcases efficient tree manipulation and traversal techniques, providing a practical example of binary search tree implementation in C++.
