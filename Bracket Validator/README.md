### Project Name
**Bracket Validator**

### Description
Developed a C++ application to validate bracket order and nesting using stack and priority queue data structures. This project was originally completed as a school assignment in Spring 2023 when I was initially introduced to data structures. The application reads bracket sequences from an input file, checks their validity by ensuring proper order and nesting, and outputs the results to an output file, categorizing sequences as "Valid" or "Invalid."

The validation process involves two main functions:

- **followsBracketOrder**: Ensures that brackets follow a specific hierarchical order using a priority queue.
- **areBracketsValid**: Uses a stack to ensure that all brackets are properly matched and nested, based on the order verified by the first function.

The application effectively demonstrates the use of stack and priority queue data structures to manage dynamic data, sort elements, and validate patterns within strings. It reads input data from files, processes complex string manipulations, and writes the results to an output file, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Having initially implemented this project in C++, I decided to enhance my skills further by recoding the project in Python and JAVA. This allowed me to explore different programming paradigms and improve my versatility in handling data structures and algorithms across multiple programming languages.
